## 🧠 Behavioral Biases and Investor Decision Making

[cite_start]This repository contains the final year dissertation report for the Integrated BBA-MBA (Finance specialization) submitted to the School of Business, UPES, Dehradun[cite: 191, 192, 198, 200].

### Project Overview

[cite_start]This study, titled **"How Different Biases impact on Investor Decision Making"** [cite: 190][cite_start], investigates the influence of cognitive and emotional behavioral biases on the investment choices made by individuals and institutions[cite: 252, 315]. [cite_start]The core goal was to enhance understanding of how psychological factors lead to deviations from rational decision-making in financial markets[cite: 254, 289].

### Key Research Areas

* [cite_start]**Identified Biases:** Focused on measuring the prevalence and impact of Overconfidence, Loss Aversion, Herd Behavior, and Anchoring[cite: 926, 927].
* [cite_start]**Comparative Analysis:** Compared the differences in biases between individual (retail) and institutional investors[cite: 318, 328, 935].
* [cite_start]**Regional Impact:** Examined how cultural and geographical diversity influences investor behavior using data from **India, Russia, and Vietnam**[cite: 319, 619, 940].
* [cite_start]**Framework Development:** Proposed the **Behavioral Investment Decision-Making Model (BIDMM)** to systematically identify, assess, and mitigate these biases in the investment process[cite: 455, 466, 995].

### Methodology

[cite_start]The research employed a comprehensive **mixed-methods strategy** [cite: 522] utilizing both quantitative and qualitative data:

| Method | Data Source | Purpose & Findings |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Quantitative Analysis** | [cite_start]**Google Trends** Data [cite: 614] | [cite_start]Analyzed search volumes for investment terms (e.g., "cryptocurrency investing," "gold investment") to identify market-wide biases like **Herd Behavior** and **Recency Bias**[cite: 615, 617, 943]. |
| | [cite_start]**Investor Survey** (N=100) [cite: 663] | [cite_start]Measured the mean scores of biases in individual investors; confirmed high prevalence of **Loss Aversion** (Mean: 4.1)[cite: 665, 805, 927]. |
| **Qualitative Analysis** | [cite_start]**Semi-Structured Interviews** [cite: 611, 1042] | [cite_start]Provided thematic insights into the *causes* of biases (e.g., individual investors influenced by social media, institutional investors by competitive pressure)[cite: 816, 844, 874]. |
| | [cite_start]**Case Studies** [cite: 675] | [cite_start]Analyzed real-world events like the **2008 Financial Crisis** and the **2021 GameStop Short Squeeze** to illustrate the systemic impact of herd behavior and overconfidence[cite: 490, 496, 679, 680]. |

### Key Findings & Contributions

* [cite_start]**Prevalent Biases:** Overconfidence, Loss Aversion, and Herd Behavior were confirmed as the most common biases among individual investors[cite: 926].
* [cite_start]**Systemic Risk:** Biases among institutional investors, driven by competitive pressure, were shown to contribute to systemic risk, as demonstrated by the 2008 crisis analysis[cite: 951, 970].
* [cite_start]**Regional Contrast:** India showed a cultural bias toward secure assets (high search volume for "gold investment") [cite: 942][cite_start], while Russia and Vietnam exhibited a pronounced **Recency Bias** toward speculative assets (high search volume for "cryptocurrency investing")[cite: 943].
* [cite_start]**Practical Framework:** The study concludes with practical **recommendations** for investors and financial professionals, focusing on tailored investor education, leveraging robo-advisors, and implementing bias-resistant risk management protocols[cite: 964, 974, 986].
